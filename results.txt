Closest Key frame Approach:
Classifier has selected frames i.e. bsplineder.txt, true labels and features.csv file as input.
Natta accuracy=85.7885615251%
Natta1 accuracy=69.1717791411% (less due to tracking of just right hand) 

My task:
Given an test adavu video, identify top k (say 20) frames and find its k*48 dimensional feature vector.
Classify the video for an adavu using training data.
